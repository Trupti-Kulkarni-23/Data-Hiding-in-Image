    <h1>Steganography</h1>
    <p>
        Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or
        video within another file, message, image, or video. The word
        steganography comes from Greek, meaning "covered writing". The goal of
        steganography is to hide the existence of the information being
        communicated.
    </p>

    <h2>Steganography vs Cryptography</h2>
    <p>
        While both steganography and cryptography are techniques used for secure
        communication, they differ in their approach:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Steganography:</strong> In steganography, the focus is on
            hiding the existence of the message itself. It conceals the message
            within another file or medium, making it appear as innocent data. The
            goal is to prevent detection of the message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cryptography:</strong> Cryptography, on the other hand,
            focuses on encrypting the message to make it unreadable to anyone
            without the proper decryption key. The goal is to prevent unauthorized
            access to the content of the message.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Steganography in Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
        Steganography plays a crucial role in cybersecurity for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Covert Communication:</strong> Steganography enables covert
            communication, allowing users to transmit sensitive information
            without arousing suspicion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Security Through Obscurity:</strong> By hiding messages within
            seemingly innocuous data, steganography provides an additional layer
            of security, making it difficult for attackers to identify and
            intercept sensitive information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Counterintelligence:</strong> Steganography can be used for
            counterintelligence purposes, such as embedding tracking or
            watermarking information to identify unauthorized distribution or
            access.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Resilience Against Attacks:</strong> In some cases,
            steganography can offer resilience against cryptographic attacks by
            providing an additional layer of obfuscation.
        </li>
    </ul>
