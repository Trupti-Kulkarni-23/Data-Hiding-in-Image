Reversible data hiding in images is a smart way to hide extra data without changing the original image. 
It's used in fields like medicine and security. The goal is to add hidden data without changing what the image looks like, and to easily get back the original image later.
This technique is important for secure communication, but it's challenging to balance hiding enough data without making the image look different. 
Making reversible data hiding work well means finding ways to handle these challenges effectively.
